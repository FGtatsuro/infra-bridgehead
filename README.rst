|Build Status|

This project generates the base image for various infrastructures.

It is mainly used for infrastructure testing on CI.
The contents it includes are  as follows.

- Python(>= 2.7.9)

Supported image platforms are here.

- Docker container(https://hub.docker.com/r/fgtatsuro/infra-bridgehead/)

  - Ubuntu

Requirements
------------

The dependencies on other softwares/librarys for this project.

Supported build environments are here.

- Ubuntu(>= 14.04)

  - Python (2.7.x)
  - Docker

How to
------

1. Build base image.

.. code:: bash

    $ ansible-playbook playbooks/base.yml -i inventory/default -l container \
      --tags "python" \
      --extra-vars="docker_base_image=ubuntu:18.04 docker_commit_image=fgtatsuro/infra-bridgehead:ubuntu-18.04"

2. If you want to upload the image, you need to use the way for each image type.

.. code:: bash

    # Docker
    $ docker login -e="$DOCKER_EMAIL" -u="$DOCKER_USERNAME" -p="$DOCKER_PASSWORD"
    $ docker push fgtatsuro/infra-bridgehead:ubuntu-18.04

Notes
-----

The images generated by this project include packages related to development tools/headers.
For example,

- python-dev
- build-essential

This is because I assume that the images are used for not only single role(ex. container having only one feature),
but also multi roles(ex. Jenkins slave testing multiple features with several dependencies).
In this case, development tools/headers will be needed several times,
and the time they are no longer needed depends on the projects which use the images.

Thus, this project delegates the responsibility clearing such contents to users.
